# Data-Visualization-Portfolio

The present repository is structured with the following structure: There are three blocks of data with four visualizations each. Each block has a R document with the code used to plot the different visualizations. All data was collected from public sources and have only an educative purpose as this portfolio is part of the assignment for the Data Visualization and Analytics Module of the Harper Adams University.

WILDLIFE STRIKES BLOCK
This block of visualizations was created using the data from the public Github repository https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-07-23.
The data sheets associated with this block are “Strikes2.xlsx”, “Strikes3.xlsx”, “Strikes4.xlsx” and “Strikes6.xlsx”, and the R code used for the visualizations can be found in the document “Strikes.R”. Regarding the final visualizations (except for the animated), the documents for this block are “PlotStrikes1”, “PlotStrikes2” and “PlotStrikes3”.
This data compiles wildlife strikes made by planes and reported from pilots of different companies. It has information on the height of impact, the taxon, the moment of the day…
  Visualization 1 (“PlotStrikes1.png ”):Scatterplot of height vs speed of the plane splitted by damage to the wildlife. The code used to create this plot can be found in “Strikes.R”, Plot 1.
  Visualization 2 (“PlotStrikes2.png ”): Height of incidents for different taxons along the day. The code used to create this plot can be found in “Strikes.R”, Plot 3.
  Visualization 3 (“PlotStrikes3.png ”): Barplot of pilot reports by Company. The code used to create this plot can be found in “Strikes.R”, Plot 2. Later, company logos were included.
  Visualization 4 (Interactive): Race barplot of species strikes through the years. The code used to create this plot can be found in “Strikes.R”, Plot 4.

HIMALAYAN EXPEDITIONS BLOCK
This block of visualizations was created using the data from the public Github repository https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-09-22.
The data sheets associated with this block are “Peaks1.xlsx”, “Peaks2.xlsx” and “Peaks3.xlsx” and the R code used for the visualizations can be found in the document “Peaks.R”. Regarding the final visualizations (except for the animated), the documents for this block are “PlotPeaks1”, “PlotPeaks2” and “PlotPeaks3”.
This data compiles information on the expeditions to the Himalaya’s peaks and their expedition members from 1905 to 2004. It has information on the members: citizenship, height of death (in some of the cases), if they were hired…, and information on the expeditions, highest elevation point, success, number of members, whether they used oxygen… 
  Visualization 1 (“PlotPeaks1.png ”): Citizenship of climbers. The code used to create this plot can be found in “Peaks.R”, Plot 2. Later, flags and background were included.
  Visualization 2 (“PlotPeaks2.png ”): Elevation highpoint depending on season. The code used to create this plot can be found in “Peaks.R”, Plot 3.
  Visualization 3 (“PlotPeaks3.png ”): Death Height in different peaks. The code used to create this plot can be found in “Peaks.R”, Plot 1. Later, background was included.
  Visualization 4 (Interactive): Elevation highpoint through the years. The code used to create this plot can be found in “Peaks.R”, Plot 4.
  
  DAIR PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION BLOCK
This block of visualizations was created using the data from the public Github repository https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-01-29.
The data sheets associated with this block are “cheese.xlsx”, “cheese1.xlsx” and “dairyproducts.xlsx” and the R code used for the visualizations can be found in the document “Cheese.R”. Regarding the final visualizations (except for the animated), the documents for this block are “PlotMilk1”, “PlotMilk2” and “PlotMilk3”.
This data compiles information on the production and consumption of milk and dairy products in the USA and the economic values of these products and other related goods.
Visualization 1 (“PlotMilk1.png ”): Price Fluctuations of Milk in the EEUU. The code used to create this plot can be found in “Cheese.R”, Plot 4.
Visualization 2 (“PlotMilk2.png ”): Average cheese comsuption per person. The code used to create this plot can be found in “Cheese.R”, Plot 1. Later, background and cheese clipart was included.
Visualization 3 (“PlotMilk3.png ”): Differences in diary products consumptions through the years. The code used to create this plot can be found in “Cheese.R”, Plot 2.
Visualization 4 (Interactive): Trends on Whole and Low Fat Milk in late years. The code used to create this plot can be found in “Cheese.R”, Plot 3.
